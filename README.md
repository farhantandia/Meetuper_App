# meetuper_app

personal project of intermediate level Flutter app which implement many cores of flutter app development such as:

- Flutter widgets (buttons, listview, builder, images),
- Routes and Navigation (route pages, bottom navigation bar),
- Login & authentication (login and register data validation),
- State Management (stateless, stateful, bloc, inherited widget),
- API handling (fetch API data from and to local database),
- Animations, Fonts, and other packages!

This app is called Meetuper, it is simply used to make, organize, and join some social events. I make this app as a baseline to make more interactive Flutter apps in the future.

*This app need server to implement via simulator to perform authentication and save user data, in this case i used mongoDB.
